The UI system consists of one canvas which acts as the root of the GUI-element tree.
A panel has either the canvas or another panel as its parent. 
All children of any gui-element must have the relative position to parent.
The UI/system should have a way of disabling gui-elements so when disabled, they are not drawn.
